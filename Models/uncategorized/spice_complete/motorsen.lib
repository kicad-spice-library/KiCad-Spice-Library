* Motorola Pressure Sensor Macromodel Library
* Rev 1.0
*
* Macromodels, simulation models, or other models provided by
* Motorola, directly or indirectly, are not warranted by
* Motorola as fully representing all of the specifications and
* operating characteristics of the semiconductor product to
* which the model relates. Moreover, these models are
* furnished on an "as is" basis without support or warranty of
* any kind, either expressed or implied, regarding the use
* thereof and Motorola specifically disclaims all implied
* warranties of merchantability and fitness of the models for
* any purpose. Motorola does not assume any liability arising
* out of the application or use of the models including
* infringement of patents and copyrights nor does Motorola
* convey any license under its patents and copyrights or the
* rights of others. Motorola reserves the right to make
* changes without notice to any model.

* 
* 
* Although macromodels can be a useful tool in evaluating
* device performance in various applications, they cannot
* model exact device performance under all conditions, nor are
* they intended to replace breadboarding for final
* verification.
* 
* The purpose of this library is to model what the Motorola
* MPX series pressure sensor device data book represents.
*
* This library consists of three parts:
*
* 1. MPX Basic Pressure Sensors 
* 2. MPX Compensated Pressure Sensors
* 3. MPX Integrated Pressure Sensors
*
* The MPX Basic Pressure Sensors and the MPX Compensated Pressure 
* Sensors are jointly developed by Jeff Baum and Aiteen Zhang. 
* The Integrated Pressure Sensors is developed by Aiteen Zhang
* using the transfer functions given in the device data book.
*
* In order to use this library, several statements are required in
* your source file (xxx.cir): 
*
* 1) a subcircuit statement, X1 <node name> <subcircuit name> 
*    to call the particular device model.
* 2) a library statement, .LIB <this library name>
*    to call this library.
*
* In addition, the pressure inputs (nodes 5 and 6 for basic and
* compensated sensor models, nodes 7 and 8 for the integrated
* sensor model) are intended to be connected to an independent
* voltage source that represents the differential pressure across
* the sensor device. A second independent voltage source can be
* connected from node 6 or 8 to circuit ground to represent the
* common mode pressure seen at both pressure inputs. Connecting
* node 6 or 8 directly to ground potential is analogous to applying
* an absolute or gage pressure to the sensor device.

* Supply Input 
* ------------
* A small value of 1  is chosen for RS1 so that the supply voltage is almost 
* 100% at dc.  The users should change this value to the source resistance of 
* the voltage source they are using in order to see the electrical response 
* time.
* RS2 = Zin. The value of the input resistance, Zin, is chosen based on the 
* data given by the data book.
* A measured value of 20pF is assigned to CS.

*                           voltage.
* SENS = 0.2 mV/kPa         Pressure sensitivity at 25C and 10V excitation 
*                           voltage.
* TCVfss = -0.01176 %/C    Based on current process (depth of sensor element 
*                           and doping).
* TCVoff = 0.01176 mV/C    Due to CTE mismatches and thermal package
